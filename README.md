## 🌍 **Background & Journey**

🇿🇦 **From the Heart of South Africa:** 
Born in Klerksdorp, North West, and currently calling the beautiful Saldanha, Western Cape my home.

👨‍💻 **How It All Began:** 
My journey into the tech world started at HLT Computers in Saldanha. The monotony of typing system maintenance commands led me to play around with command prompt scripts, which gave birth to my first automation project, [AIO](https://github.com/coff33ninja/AIO).

🐍 **The Evolution to GUI:** 
From command-line fascination, my interests evolved towards GUI-based automation, leading to the creation of [NexTool](https://github.com/coff33ninja/NexTool-Windows-Suite), a holistic Python GUI to streamline work processes.

🛠 **DIY & Open Source Enthusiast:** 
I've delved into DIY DC-based projects, controlling household objects via voice or remote. Given the frequent "brownouts" in our region, I’ve chosen DC-based solutions with solar and battery power to stay ahead.

📚 **Personal Interests:** 
Manga and Anime are my escape routes. Mainstream cinema, with its repetitive actor castings, doesn’t resonate with me anymore.

🖥 **Tech Preferences:** 
- **Operating Systems:** Windows remains my primary choice, with its continuous evolution. Linux, especially for hosting services like Pterodactyl for Minecraft or Tactical RMM, is my second preference. Even a Raspberry Pi or an old 4th gen machine with Ubuntu can work wonders.
- **Code Editors:** Whether I’m mobile or at my desk, VsCode, Notepad, and Notepad++ are my go-to editors.
